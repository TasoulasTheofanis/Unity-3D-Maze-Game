# Unity-3D-Maze-Game
A simple maze game where the user should find his way out, jump through some cubes, destroy some cubes, find keys and unlock doors.


The first level is the most exciting one. Apart from the difficulty of finding the right entrance, it also contains the most obstacles. The action starts at the beginning, and things are relaxing on the next levels.

The blue bar that moves and must be avoided, the green blocks should be jumped, the keys needs to be gathered and the doors to be unlocked, the red cubes have to be shot. All those feautures are making the game quite enriched. Red cubes can disappear if the user shoots them three times.

Once the player has found the correct labyrinth path, he will proceed to the next level by entering a chimney and falling down. Inside, there may be red cubes to shoot them. In fact, you may need to jump first and then shoot it.

The second track has fewer obstacles but more walls and more dead-end roads. Therefore, the challenge of all levels differ. However, the size on all levels is the same.

The third track has even fewer obstacles and much more complexity in finding the way out.

The last track contains a red floor, which means that the player will shoot the ground 3 times to clear the floor. He will then drop into the final layer and finish the game. To do this, he goes up to the walls that surround him. Consequently, the walls mark the final boundary of the track and the exit of the labyrinth. Here ends the game and the player is the winner.
